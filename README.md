# Good,Cheap,Fast Project

This Project was bootstrapped with ReactJs.

# Project Description

The "Good/Cheap/Fast" rule reflects the trouble of project menagement and client service. This rule uses a triangle to depict and constrain the attributes of a project that are usually in conflict during development, schedule, quality and budget. The rule of "Good/Cheap/Fast" states that a customer can choose only two of these attributes to maximize. The third, unchosen attribute, will naturally suffer. This is a physical constraint of a triangle and realistic constraint of a project.
